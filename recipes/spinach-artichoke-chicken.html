        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ (10 ounce) package frozen spinach</li>

            <li>1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
                
            <li>½ (14 ounce) can quartered artichoke hearts, drained and chopped</li>
                
            <li>¼ cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
                
            <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
                
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                
            <li>4 (8 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
                
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                
            <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Microwave spinach in a medium bowl until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Let cool slightly and squeeze to remove excess moisture.</li>
            <li>Return spinach to the bowl. Mix in cream cheese, artichoke hearts, Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, garlic powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Pound chicken breasts to an even thickness, no more than 1-inch-thick. Season with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken breasts in the hot oil, 2 to 3 minutes, working in batches if necessary. Place chicken breasts in a large baking dish. Spread spinach-artichoke mixture on top of each breast.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 22 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Top breasts with the mozzarella cheese and continue baking until cheese has melted, 1 to 2 more minutes.</li>
        </ol>
