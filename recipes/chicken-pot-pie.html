            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
                
            <li>1 ½ ounces bacon</li>
                
            <li>⅓ cup diced onion</li>
                
            <li>⅓ cup diced carrots</li>
                
            <li>⅓ cup chopped celery</li>
                
            <li>7 ½ ounces chicken breast, cubed</li>
                
            <li>⅓ cup frozen peas</li>

            <li>2 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced</li>

            <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>

            <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>

            <li>1 ½ tablespoons water</li>

            <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to <strong>120 degrees F</strong> (50 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Put cauliflower into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until it resembles rice. Transfer to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 5 minutes. Set aside and cool cauliflower completely, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place cauliflower rice in a cheesecloth and squeeze out as much water as possible to ensure that it crisps during the cooking process. Spread cauliflower onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Stir and continue baking about 7 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Remove cauliflower from the oven and stir to mix and dry as it cools.</li>
            <li>Increase the oven to <strong>400 degrees F</strong> (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Put cooled cauliflower rice into a bowl. Add 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, egg, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper and mix until completely combined. Press mixture into the bottom and around the edges of an 8-inch round, nonstick, baking pan to form a crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat and cook bacon until crisp and the fat has rendered. Add onion, carrot, and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add peas and mushrooms; cook until mushrooms have softened and peas are heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour chicken broth and cream into the skillet with the chicken mixture. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and stir well. Reduce heat and simmer at a low boil until sauce has reduced by one-fourth, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix cornstarch and water together in a bowl to create a paste. Add slowly to the chicken mixture in the skillet, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens. Pour chicken mixture into prebaked cauliflower crust. Top with remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Place chicken pot pie under the broiler until browned and bubbling, 5 to 10 minutes. Allow to cool about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
